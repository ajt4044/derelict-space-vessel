Here is the link to my updated project; the location is still the same:

https://glitch.com/~quixotic-canary
or
quixotic-canary.glitch.me

A few notes:

Both the plant and the computer need multiple clicks to get through everything I coded. Also, there are often issues
with clicks being registered, and in this case it may be necessary to reload the page. It also can help to just wait a while before clicking, 
and/or hold down the mouse button when doing so. 

The reference picture I used to create my project is still contained in my repository.
